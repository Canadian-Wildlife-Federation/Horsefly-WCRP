# Vision Statement 

Healthy, well-connected streams and rivers within the Horsefly River watershed support thriving populations of migratory fish, improving the overall ecosystem health of the watershed. In turn, these fish provide the continued sustenance, cultural, and ceremonial needs of the Northern Secw√©pemc people, as they have since time immemorial. Both residents and visitors to the watershed work together to mitigate the negative effects of anthropogenic aquatic barriers, improving the resiliency of streams and rivers for the benefit and appreciation of all.
